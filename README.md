My new website (not yet online).
Completely static (bye wordpress slowness!) and based on a beautiful free HTML5 template.

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of n33.co
(my personal site). Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
